# h264toh265

Tool based on ffmpeg to convert videos in H264 format to H265. 
H265 is also known as x265 or HEVC. 

See https://x265.readthedocs.io or 'man ffmpeg-codecs'

FFmpeg options makes converted videos output in h265@10bits with no quality loss !

-rw-r--r--  1 fdef fdef 156M  1 janv. 16:51 MVI_7556_x265.MP4
```

## Vars

```
LOGFILE             : The log file indeed !
LOGFILE_ERR         : List videos files that are failed to encode.
LISTLOG             : List processed video files
OVERRIDE_SRCFILE    : Replace source file by the converted file (default=false)
